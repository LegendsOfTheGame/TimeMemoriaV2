Time Memoria Versioning Specification (v2)
Format: AA.B.C.D

Time Memoria keeps the Memoria Alpha style versioning format because it matches how we think about Dalamud API level, expansion bands, and bucket/drawer completion, which we still need for lazy‑loaded quest data. Version numbers describe what content is covered, not which optional modules are enabled.
AA – Dalamud API version
B – Expansion band (ARR, HW, etc.)
C – Expansion patch band (x.0–x.5)
D – Drawer/Bucket completion for that band/patch

IMPORTANT: Version progression
    14.0.0.0 — Fresh QuestTracker fork renamed to Time Memoria, infrastructure phase, may still use the original QT data layout.
    14.2.0.1 — First Time Memoria v2 milestone: Quest UI working on ARR 2.0 data, News / Events restored, PlaytimeStats & global pacing implemented, and ARR 2.0 MSQ bucket extracted (legacy monolithic data deprecated).
The transition from B = 0 to B = 2 happens when the first expansion‑organized bucket (e.g., ARR 2.0 MSQ) is created and hooked into the UI.

Time Memoria’s modules (Quest UI, News/Events, PlaytimeStats & Pacing, future Ocean Fishing helper) are tracked in the README and release notes, not encoded into the version digits.
AA – Dalamud API Version
    AA tracks which Dalamud/FFXIV major version the build targets.
14 = FFXIV Patch 7.4–7.49 / early 7.5 cycle (current)
15 = FFXIV Patch 7.5+ (future)

Increment AA only when Dalamud releases a new major API version; this is independent of content coverage.

B – Expansion Index
    B matches the expansion band of the quest content this build primarily targets.
        2 = A Realm Reborn (ARR 2.x)
        3 = Heavensward (HW 3.x)
        4 = Stormblood (StB 4.x)
        5 = Shadowbringers (ShB 5.x)
        6 = Endwalker (EW 6.x)
        7 = Dawntrail (DT 7.x)
​
For the first Time Memoria v2 milestone (ARR MSQ‑focused), B = 2.

C – Expansion Patch Number
    C tracks which patch slice of that expansion band the quest buckets cover.
        0 = x.0 (launch patch)
        1 = x.1
        2 = x.2
        3 = x.3
        4 = x.4
        5 = x.5 (including any .55 follow‑ups as part of .5)
For base game prior to any major patch, C will always be 0 (x.0)

D – Drawer/Bucket Completion Milestone
D tracks how many quest buckets are complete for the given expansion/patch. This stays tied to the bucketed/lazy‑load approach used by the Quest UI.
    0 = Folder exists, no buckets complete
    1 = MSQ bucket complete (1‑msq.json)
    2 = New Era bucket complete (2‑NewEra.json)
    3 = Feature bucket complete (3‑Feature.json)
    4 = Beasts bucket complete (4‑Beasts.json)
    5 = Class/Job bucket complete (5‑Class.json)
    6 = Seasonal bucket complete (6‑Seasonal.json)
    7 = Levequests and Guildhests (7-Leve.json)
    8 = Other bucket complete (8‑Other.json)
    9 = All buckets for that band/patch complete
​
How Time Memoria Modules Fit In (v2)
    Time Memoria adds new modules on top of the QuestTracker base:
        Quest UI (QuestTracker evolution, bucketed & lazy‑loaded).
        News/Events (XIV ToDo world‑state info plus local pacing lines).
        PlaytimeStats & Pacing (session/lifetime playtime tracking and quest‑pacing statistics, UI‑only).
        Ocean Fishing helper (future, clearly out of scope for 7.5).

These modules are not encoded directly into AA.B.C.D. Instead, the numeric version tells you:
    Which API you target (AA).
    Which expansion band/patch your quest data/buckets cover (B.C).
    How many quest buckets are complete for that band/patch (D).

The README / changelog includes a “Module State” table for each release, e.g.:
    Quest UI (QT evolution): ✅ / ❌
    News/Events (XIV ToDo + pacing): ✅ / ❌
    PlaytimeStats & Pacing: ✅ / ❌
    Ocean Fishing helper: ✅ / ❌

This keeps version numbers stable and familiar while still documenting Time Memoria’s evolution clearly for users and reviewers.
​
Current Target (v2)
First public/test milestone of Time Memoria v2: 14.2.0.1

Meaning:
14 – Dalamud API 14 (FFXIV 7.4–7.49 / early 7.5).
2 – ARR band (A Realm Reborn).
0 – ARR 2.0 (launch patch).
1 – MSQ bucket complete (1‑msq.json extracted and lazy‑loaded).

Module state for 14.2.0.1 (documented in README, not in digits):
Quest UI (QT evolution): ✅ Full QT‑style browser with at least ARR 2.0 MSQ bucket wired.
News/Events: ✅ XIV ToDo rows plus global session & lifetime pacing lines in the News / Events tab.
PlaytimeStats & Pacing: ✅ Session and lifetime playtime tracking and per‑quest pacing, UI‑only, no chat.
Ocean Fishing: ❌ (future).
You can treat 14.2.0.1 as the ‘7.5‑ready’ build: a clean QuestTracker evolution with News/Events and pacing, with all ARR 2.0 MSQ in buckets and other quests still served from QuestTracker’s legacy data.json (shipped temporarily until bucket migration is complete).

Example Progression (v2)
Some realistic future steps:
    14.2.0.0 – Fork QuestTracker, rename to Time Memoria, quest data structure in place, no buckets complete yet; basic UI loads.
    14.2.0.1 – ARR 2.0 MSQ bucket complete (D = 1), News/Events restored, PlaytimeStats & global pacing implemented.
    14.2.0.2 – ARR 2.0 MSQ + New Era buckets complete (D = 2), optional MSQ/non‑MSQ pacing toggle added.
    14.2.5.9 – All ARR buckets complete for 2.0–2.5 (D = 9), ahead of the 8.0 window target.
    14.3.0.1 – Shift primary focus to HW 3.0 MSQ (B = 3, C = 0, D = 1) while keeping News/Events and pacing stable.
    15.3.0.1 – Update to API 15 when FFXIV 7.5+ Dalamud lands, with HW 3.0 MSQ bucket complete.
